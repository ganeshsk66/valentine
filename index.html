You will never regret by choosing me.\n\n  So from the very first moment I met you, I felt something special—your smile caught my heart, and your laughter brought me a joy I had never known. As we spent more time together, my feelings grew stronger; every conversation, every shared glance, every little moment made me realize how natural and comforting it felt to be with you. Slowly, I understood that being with you wasn’t just happiness—it felt like home. Your kindness, your dreams, and the way you make life brighter for me made me see that you are the one I’ve been waiting for. Now, I can’t imagine my life without you, and I choose you, Pihu, not just for a moment, but for a lifetime, as my partner, my heart, and my forever.",

Every time you meet my eyes, Pihu, I feel understood, cherished, and completely safe. That look makes me fall a little more in love with you each time, and in those moments, I see not just love, but a future where we belong together, sharing every joy and dream.",

The mountains behind us stand tall and steadfast, but even their grandeur fades compared to the strength, beauty, and calm I feel with you, Pihu. Each step we take together feels steady and sure, as if the world around us bows to the quiet power of our love. Holding your hand in mine makes me feel grounded, protected, and endlessly grateful that I get to walk through life with you by my side.",

I still can’t believe I got stuck with you, Pihu — and by ‘stuck,’ I mean the best, most ridiculously perfect person ever.",

You looked absolutely stunning, and I felt like the luckiest person just standing next to you. Sitting across from you at dinner, sharing bites, stealing smiles, and teasing each other, it felt like the world had paused just for us. Every laugh, every glance, every little moment that night made me realize again how perfect it is to have you by my side, not just on birthdays, but every single day.",

Our prayers, hopes, and wishes blend into one, and it feels comforting to know that we support each other not just in life but in faith too. Together, we hope for the best, dream big, and trust that the universe will guide us. Knowing that we stand side by side, praying for good things for ourselves and each other, makes our bond feel deeper, stronger, and truly blessed.",
